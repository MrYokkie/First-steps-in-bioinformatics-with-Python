# Metagenomic and Bioinformatic Analysis Toolkit

This repository contains scripts and notebooks for performing metagenomic and bioinformatic analyses, specifically focusing on 16S rRNA gene sequencing and ITS (Internal Transcribed Spacer) data. 
The provided scripts cover essential steps in data processing, statistical analysis, and visualization for microbial community analysis.

### Introduction

This repository includes R scripts and Jupyter notebooks dedicated to the analysis of metagenomic datasets. 
The analysis workflow involves quality control, data processing, and statistical analysis of 16S and ITS sequencing data, commonly used for profiling bacterial and fungal communities, respectively. 
A separate Python notebook is included for bioinformatics analysis.

### Usage
**16S rRNA Analysis**
For analyzing 16S rRNA data, use the All_in_one_16S.R script. It includes steps for:

- Data preprocessing (trimming, filtering)
- Taxonomic classification
- Alpha and beta diversity analysis
- Visualization of results

**To run the script:**
Rscript All_in_one_16S.R

**ITS Analysis**
For ITS data, use the All_in_one_ITS.R script, which performs similar functions as the 16S workflow but is tailored to fungal ITS sequencing data.
**To run the script:**
Rscript All_in_one_ITS.R

**Bioinformatic Analysis**
The Jupyter notebook BioPy(trial).ipynb includes various bioinformatic functions implemented in Python, focusing on sequence processing and exploratory data analysis. 
It is meant to complement the R scripts and provide a trial Python-based workflow for bioinformatic analysis.
